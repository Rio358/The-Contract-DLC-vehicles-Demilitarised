# The-Contract-DLC-vehicles-Demilitarised
This is an edit of the .meta files of The Contract DLC vehicles from GTA Online edited by @Rio for FiveM Roleplay Servers. I am releasing this on behalf of Rio. I had no part in the editing or creation of this edit. These vehicles' weapons, armor and bullet resistance have been removed to the best of Rio's ability. This is an asset that many Roleplay servers would love to have for their civilian roleplayers. I hope you enjoy it!
Ensure first that your fivem server has been updated to the latest build (2245)
Unzip the folder then drag and drop contract_metas folder into you resource folder, add the folder name to server.cfg and save. You are all set!
